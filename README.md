Hello. This is my journey to understanding how neural networks work. I will be building projects moving up a level every time.

**Digit Recognizer**
My first very simple neural network, used mathematical reasoning to reason out my model. Used numpy and matplotlib to implement a decent digit recognizer with an 86% accuracy. /n
